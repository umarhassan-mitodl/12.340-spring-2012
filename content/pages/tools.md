MIT Single-Column Model
-----------------------

The MIT single-column model is a one-dimensional, time-dependent code that solves equations for radiative and convective heat transfer. The model is written in Fortran 77, with output in ordinary ASCII files; MATLAB® scripts are also provided to display the output. The model is used in Problem Set 3.

Instructions for installing and running the model, plus more details on the model’s scope, objectives, and assumptions, are in the {{% resource_link 70e3ee6c-742d-bcba-a978-48bc8da3912f "MIT Single-Column Model User's Guide (PDF)" %}}. _**NOTE**: No user support beyond this guide can be provided._
